There has been a lot of research which shows the importance of physical
health in avoiding anxiety and depression . The mind and the body are
highly interconnected . We can all make fairly easy changes in our
lifestyle to include more exercise , healthier eating , getting enough sleep,
being exposed to sunlight and so on. Research into exercise has found
that it has a positive impact on mood. Physical activity stimulates the
release of endorphins in the brain to produce the feel-good factor . Sleep
is vitally important for children and adolescents to help concentration
levels. A good night's sleep also stops people being bad-tempered and
flying off the handle .
